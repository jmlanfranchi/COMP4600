How to Run: Unfortunately, this is not able to be ran on its own. The file requires files in proper directories and the MURA 
dataset uploaded to Google Drive. This project was done using and intended for Google Colab and as such will affect 
how it must be ran. Refer to the top of the ipynb file for other instructions/information.
